        <p>Hey, I'm <strong>Marc</strong> and i work for the next generation
            of open source developers</p>
            <p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. software is 
                unbliquitious and every<br/> person can now build their way to a future
                that inspires them. However, <strong>Today's world<br/> isn't designed to work for these creators</strong>
                 creating an imbalance between the impacts<br/> they're capable of, and what's expected of them
            </p>
            <p>I'm working to solve this problems....</p>

    <p>Currently I am working as a <strong>Chief Technology Officer</strong> at<a href="AQVC">AQVC</a>
    . it's an amazing place<br/> where i get to work alongside great people on our
 vision to democratize the access to<br/> to venture capital.</p>
 <p>I'm currently living in <strong>munich, Germany.</strong> some other places i have lived in are 
Helsinki,<br/> Gerlin, San Fransisco, Honng Gong, and Toronto.</p>

        <h2>Previously</h2>
        <p>I founded and built<a href="Hackerby">Hackerby</a>as CTO with three awesome friens.
         We took a small<br/> insight from hackathons-<i>software is not a 12 month cycle-</i> 
       and built<br/> up a B2B company.We worked with TWitter,Vodafone, Alliianz and some
     some of Germany's<br/> largest corporations. With<a href="NFX">NFX</a>We had incredible investors 
    on board and always an<br/> open ear from James, Peter, or Gigi.</p>
    <p>After five years of immense personaland proffessional growth, priorities<br>changed and we decided to pursue
    new opportunities, were each of our<br/>personal strenghts are best put to use.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    for me that's the<strong>building tools to improve the economics of open source</strong>.<br/>
